# Abstract
In the past, when buying an item, one had to trust reviews in newspapers or from friends. In todays age, with online shopping, we have to tap into the minds of thousands of people who have purchased the product we are thinking about. With the help of Amazon reviews and their star-system, we can easily analyse how well to product likely is. But while a newspaper or professional reviewer is generally working hard for consistency and unbiasedness, these facts are not given for a general public reviewer writing a comment. With help of the Amazon dataset, we will try to find bias in the reviews, in order to possibly give an idea on whether or not, and if so how, to correct a bias. We will be especially interested in the influence of the following factors on the number of stars given:
-	Time the review was written
-	Type of product the review was written for
-	Style and length of the review text
-	Product Price
-	potentially shoppers activity


# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 
-	What factors influece the amount of stars given in an amazon review (other than product quality)?
-	Is there a way to correct this bias? Should we correct this bias?

# Dataset
We will use the Amazon Dataset.
We will use NLP to extract interesting features from the review text. As other features we plan to use the values provided in the product information and review.
Since the dataset is very big, we will first concentrate on books, and possibly in a second stage extend our work to general articles if time permits. Since the dataset of books is still very large, we will use a subsample of the data for prototyping.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
The main questions to answer in milestone 2:
-	How to best subsample the data (subsample books and take all reviews for 1 book or subsample reviews directly).
-	What features are at our disposal and how can we use them to answer our questions?
-	Is there a way to incorperate the metadata?
-	What features to extract by NLP from the review text?

# Questions for TAa
Add here some questions you have for us, in general or project-specific.
